## Api Timer \+ Array WithEvents


</div>

### Description

This code contains 2 classes, One is a base API timer class that can be used as a standalone timer replacement (does not need a form to host timer) The second, is a class that holds an array of these timer objects and allows you handle events of a timer array just like the default VB timer object. VB Does not have built in support for handling an array of objects withevents. So this shows you how to code it yourself.
